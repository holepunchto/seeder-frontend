## The tool

Pear seeder manages a set of [seedbees](https://github.com/holepunchto/seedbee), seed the list of cores running:

```
simple-seeder [seedbee-public-key]
```

You can create your own seedbees and add new entries or you can use the read-only mode to follow the list of cores included in a seedbee.
